                    A driven professional with a curious and analytical mind, developed
                    through a <em>Bachelor of Sciences (Life Sciences - Biomedicine)</em> and
                    an <em>A- in a Programming Methodology module in Python</em>. A career of
                    3 years in Sales and Business Development roles has built a strong client
                    focus on understanding their perspectives and objectives, together with
                    strong internal and external stakeholder management skills. Working in a
                    start-up has also nurtured the ability to contrive creative workarounds
                    with existing limitations. An amalgamation of these traits and experiences
                    have resulted in a strong track record (e.g. 128% of targets in Q3 2021 &
                    Q1 2022).

                    A passion to pursue a career in programming arose through continuous
                    exposure to technology and relevant developments, an increased global
                    focus on technology, and fond experiences from an excellent performance in
                    programming courses, coupled with curiosity and a desire to create and
                    problem-solve. In university, successfully used Python to analyse hundreds
                    of images, increasing time taken for analysis from ~4 hours (manual
                    analysis) to ~10 minutes.
